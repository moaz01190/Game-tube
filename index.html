  <h3>Half-Life: Alyx</h3>
  <p>"Not only has Half-Life: Alyx made good on its shift to VR, it has elevated
    many of the aspects we've come to love about Half-Life games. It may not be as bombastic
    as previous games, but the intimacy of VR brings you closer to a world you might have
    thought you knew over the past 22 years. Even when familiarity starts to settle in, its
    gameplay systems still shine as a cohesive whole. And as it concludes, Half-Life: Alyx hits
    you with something unforgettable, transcending VR tropes for one of gaming's greatest moments."</p>
  <h3>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h3>
  <p>"The orchestration of intense one-on-one boss encounters that truly test
    your mettle, and slower-paced stealth sections that let you take on battles
    at your own pace, is masterful. More so than in previous games, From Software
    has honed in on the inherent tension found in the challenging nature of its games,
    and uses it to incredible effect. Sekiro marries the developer's unique brand of gameplay
    with stealth action to deliver an experience that is as challenging as it is gratifying."</p>
  <h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
  <p>"While Red Dead Redemption was mostly focused on John Marston's story,
    Red Dead 2 is about the entire Van der Linde gang--as a community, as an idea,
    and as the death rattle of the Wild West. It is about Arthur, too,
    but as the lens through which you view the gang, his very personal,
    very messy story supports a larger tale. Some frustrating systems and
    a predictable mission structure end up serving that story well, though
    it does take patience to get through them and understand why. Red Dead
    Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but it's also an emotional,
    thought-provoking story in its own right, and it's a world that is
    hard to leave when it's done."</p>
